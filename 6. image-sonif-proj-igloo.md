## Image Sonification Video Project

As part of my placement, I created a another project where I sonified two images using a separate method to the one focused on in this codebook. This is using the [JythonMusic environment](https://jythonmusic.me/).

For this, I created a video experience for use in the University of Southampton Digital Humanities' 360Â° immersive audio-visual Igloo screen. This involves viewers listening to the sonifications without seeing the images first, then while being shown the images in conjunction with the sonifications.

I also created a questionnaire to accompany the video and get viewers thinking about their experience.
