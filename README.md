# Heritage Data Sonification — A Resource for Non-coders

## What

Code and data produced in 2023 by Tierra Abeyta as part of a Digital Humanities Placement project.

This repo includes:
- an in-depth write up on the purpose of this project, the importance of sonification (particularly of heritage data), and sonification methods/considerations
- a codebook adapted from Matt Russo's sonification guide, with additional code, comments, and explanations
- a codebook showing how I made my data cumulative
- my initial data sonification audio file
- my final audio file after being edited in FL Studio
- supplementary sonifications using a separate program and images

## Why

This repo was created to be a sonification guide for people without a background in coding. In the supplementary write up, I go into detail on the value of sonification as a tool for data representation, particularly with heritage data, and the inaccessibility of many sonification guides to non-coders. Ultimately, it's meant to serve as the sort of resource I wish I had when I began my project.

This is also intended to showcase my final sonifications completed during my project.

## How

The original sonification code in this repo was taken from Matt Russo's [Sonification with Python – How to Turn Data Into Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdLRy8i9qI). I then adapted the code to my own data and added additional comments to explain things I found confusing or how I resolved errors.

For my data set sonification, I followed Russo's guide using Python in Jupyter Notebook. I edited the original midi file in FL Studio.

For my image sonifications, I used the JythonMusic environment. My images were taken from [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-27354565).
